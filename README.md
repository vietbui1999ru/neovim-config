This is my basic nvim config and plugins based on [Josean Martinez's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8).

Plugins that I added:

- [x] Anki Flashcards straight from neovim.
- [x] Zen-mode for increased focus and productivity.
- [x] Nomodoro for pomodoro features
- [x] Which-key for easy keybindings hints
- [x] Neorg file support.
  - [x] support nvim-cmp, telescope, and zen-mode.
- [x] Orgmode files with support for treesitter, lsp, auto-completion, and lintins hints
  - [x] Org-bullets for beautifying bullet points.
- [x] Markdown preview and toggle for easier documentations.
- [x] Colorizer to visualize HEX, RGB, etc easier.
- [ ] Headline highlighting and other nifty colors for markdown and orgmode. (not working right now)
